# Xfwm4-Themes

#  Attention
  
  The vast majority of themes contained in this repository, do not contain buttons in their windows, 
  they use keyboard shortcuts in the majority.
  If you want to use the same pattern that is used in most themes, 
  just copy the "xfce4" file to ~ / home / .config

Or you can do your keyboard settings yourself using the Xfce settings

# Basic shortcuts

The master key is the "Super or window" key

    	-Super + numeric keys (Change the work area)
    	-Super + Return (Opens the xfce4-terminal)
    	-Super + arrows (Splits the window in the middle of the screen in both directions)
    	-Super + Shift + arrows (Divides the windows in the corners of the screen)


# Installation of themes

The installation of the themes is quite simple,
followed by 3 steps.

		-Clone the repository
		-Copy themes to ~ / .themes
		-Copy wallpapers for ~ / Images

Then just set the themes in the xfce settings, not forgetting to change the Xfwm4 theme as well

# General observations

The system is using tint2 as a panel, but I didnâ€™t find it necessary because of its settings here, because the use of bars is relative, and it depends on the personal taste of each one, and also because there are a huge number of bar options to be used , even the xfce4-panel, which is already native to the system
